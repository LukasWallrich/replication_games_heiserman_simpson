# Analysis plan

5 Studies + meta-analysis
1 separate study (Study 6, MTurk) - separate dataset

# Hypotheses

- Discrimination reduces effort
- More so among disadvantaged respondents
- Discrimination reduces beliefs about work-reward link
- Beliefs about work-reward link reduces effort
- Indirect effect is significant

H1: Disadvantage predicts reward expectations (among both advantaged and disadvantaged)

H2: Disadvantaged show lower work effort than unbiased control.
S1 (perceived)
H3: Advantaged show lower work effort than unbiased control, but highter than disadvantaged.
S1 (perceived)

Expect (partial) mediation as shaped by H1 + H2/H3

S2 - S5 all - but different variables

H4: Given greater effort by advantaged, managers will evaluate advantaged category as more competent than disadvantaged and prefer them for work opportunities.

S6

Pre-registrations for Studies 4 and 5 - compare adherence
